# Python App

A minimal Python project template using
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) for web APIs.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for fast dependency and virtual environment management.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for supporting both simple and complex testing.

Ideal for backend microservices, REST APIs, or web-based backends, with clean structure and built-in support for testing and hot reload.

```bash
brew install uv
```
